# Flappy-Bird-Clone
Flappy Bird is a simple mobile game that gained immense popularity in 2013. In the game, players control a small bird and tap the screen to make it flap its wings and navigate through a series of pipes. The objective is to fly as far as possible without colliding with the pipes or the ground. 
This is my attempt at creating Flappy Bird to be played on a PC.
